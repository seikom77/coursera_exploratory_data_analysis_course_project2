The zip file contains 2 files;
### 1. PM 2.5 Emission data
This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Here are the first few rows.

  *𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county　　
  *𝚂𝙲𝙲: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)　　
  *𝙿𝚘𝚕𝚕𝚞𝚝𝚊𝚗𝚝: A string indicating the pollutant　　
  *𝙴𝚖𝚒𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚜: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons　　
  *𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)　　
  *𝚢𝚎𝚊𝚛: The year of emissions recorded　　
  
### 2. Source Classification Code table
This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source.
